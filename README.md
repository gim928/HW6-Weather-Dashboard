# HW6-Weather-Dashboard

## Weather Forecast Application

### The objective of this project was to create a web application from scratch that allows the user to search for weather forecast information for a given city. The user can view the current weather forecast as well as the 5 day future forecast. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS and is powered by JavaScript.
